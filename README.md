the PICOtron
============

Clinical answers from systematic reviews
----------------------------------------

As described in [this presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/mavergames/sustainability-and-cochrane-reviews-how-technology-can-help-12207716)

The *PICOtron* produces summaries of systematic reviews.
Specifically, files from [RevMan 5](http://tech.cochrane.org/revman) are batch processed to HTML files.

To produce summaries, the *PICOtron* does the following:
  - retrieves intervention names from free text in Cochrane Reviews
  - calculates estimates of the absolute effects of interventions (using individual trial data in the review)
  - produces standardised, plain language, summaries of the effects of each intervention on key outcomes

This software is used by the Cochrane Collaboration, and forms the basis of [Cochrane Clinical Answers](http://cochraneclinicalanswers.com),
